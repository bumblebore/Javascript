1) User interface
           |
2) Browser Engine		bridge bw UI and render engine  //JS engine //ex V8 for chrome
           |
3) Rendering Engine	//interpreting : produces result from program , compiling = produce program in assembly then result
		// interprets HTML and XML documents with images	
		//ex of rendering engine: Chrome : Blink, IE: Trident, Firefox: Gecko
      |	                 	       |				|
4) networking        	5) Javascript Interpreter		    6) UI Backend	

get urls		interprets + execute JS code		 Draws widgets for ex
using internet	sends result to rendering 		 input box
protocols		engine


7) Data Persistence
Local DB for cache cookie,bookmarks,preferences etc



Q) How DOM Generated? Critical Rendering Path (CRP) 


CRP :
1) browser reads html,css,js files through raw bytes ->through networking layer
2) convert raw bytes -> readable html using html character encoding
3) break html file into units of parsing tokens	//tokoenization
4) convert token into nodes //Displayed in DOM
5) link nodes in a tree DOM, how? establish parent child relationships, every node relationship is established
	//DOM generated


Q) How CSSOM is processed
1) receive raw bytes
2) convert into characters
3) break into parsing tokens		//parser does
4) create nodes //displayed in CSSOM
5) CSSOM created tree structure		//browser recursively looks at this css tree structure and calculates styles


Q) How to combine both trees?
Render Tree genereated


Q) Layout of render treeelements
, on screencalculations etc, find where to position elements

Q) avoid time delay, get HTML and CSS first to client ASAP, reduce time for first render


Q) Where JS in picture? Why JS is danger to browser?Why placing script tag at bottom of body tag is important
JS helps us modify content and styling of page
So to avoid problems, Browser stops construction of both trees when JS script executing

Q) How to optimize website for performance? Optimize the entire CRP cycle
CRP strategy : helps browser load web app page as quickly possible
	how? tell what resource to load, what order to load etc
