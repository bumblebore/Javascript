 We saw different ways how to inject css in website
	1) inline
	2) internal
	3) external

Similarly for JS
Best practice to put script right at ed before closing body tag
If lot of jS code(time cosuming to run)
Atleast contents of website will be loaded
	1) Inline JS
		Add attribute into the tag
		when body is loaded, JS will get carried out
			<body onload="alert('Helo')">
				<h1> Hello </h1>
			</body>
		//"" problem, interprets Hello as string
			//Hence use single quote

	  Problem with inline JS
		Not modular
		Difficult to debug
		Not good practice
	
	2) Internal JS  //Write JS code in script tag in body tag
		<script type="text/javscript">
			alert("Hello");
		</script>

	3) External File  //write code in index.js-> add index.js in index.html

case1) insert script in <body>
1) Create a new file index.js
	alert("Hello");
	document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Good Bye";				/doc.query selector will get us entire h1 tag  ->.innerHTML will get us everything inside -> replace with GoodBye
										//look for h1 and change text to goodbye
2) in index.html
	note: where to place css file? <head>
	          where to place js file?
		<head>
		
		</head>
		<body>
		<h1> Hello </h1>
		<script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

		</body>
		</html>
case2) Insert script in <head>,loads first
	//Gives error -> cannot set property of innert html of null
		           the inner html in script looks for h1 but cannot find h1 since body is not 
			loaded yet
			
	<head>
		<script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		</head>	
		<body>
		<h1> Hello </h1>
		</body>
		</html>


Conclusion: Script maybe related to body -> so add in Body, if add before body, it may load before body is loaded

Technical:
Why script tag shouldnt in be in head if js is linked to body element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <title>Medium Article Demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script>
        let header = document.getElementById("header");

        console.log("header is: ", header);
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <p id="header">How Browser Rendering Works</p>
    <div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jDq3k3r.jpg">
</body>
</html>


1) parser constructing DOM
2) script tag found, body tag not parsed in DOM yet
3) script attempts to access DOM node with id : header , cant find, DOM has not parsed body , and body contains our id : header node
	Error: Output: header : null
	

Q) Will adding external script help? NO, DOM still not constructed in header
note: DOM construction is step by step, wait for all construction to avoid errors



Q) What if JS is loaded online form internet, DOM construction halted
Since JS can also access CSSOM,
JS execution halted, until CSSOM ready


Conclusion:
DOM stops ->until JS script executed
JS stops     -> until CSSOM is generated
