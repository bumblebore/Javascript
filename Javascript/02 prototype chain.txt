1) What is prototype chain?

 1.1) How to create child object from parent object?
	
	var child = Object.create(parent) 	//pass parent object as prototype


1.2) 

	Create parent object
		name,age property, sayHello() method

var parent = {
	name: "John",
	age: 50,
	sayHello: function() {
	  console.log("Hello my name is" +this.name + "and I am" + this.age + "years old");
	}
};

	Create a child object // pass parent object

var child = Object.create(parent);		//parent is prototype for child
child.name = "Alice";
child.age = 20;


child.sayHello();		//automatically sayHello() for child created
				//child inherited properties and methods from parent

				//order in which JS checks?
				child object --> parent pbject (child.prototype) -->
				Object.prototype -->Type error
